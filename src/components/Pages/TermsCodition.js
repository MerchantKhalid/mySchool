           <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2> 
Terms and conditions refer to the contractual rights and obligations of a party to any contract. They refer to the broader concept of guidelines that parties must follow in an agreement. Your business can create them for any formalized business agreement.

<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
In contrast, terms of service, also referred to as terms of use, are the eCommerce terms and conditions surrounding the use of a service or application and must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines. Software companies utilize them more often than other industries. Use terms of service when your company offers a business service, too.
